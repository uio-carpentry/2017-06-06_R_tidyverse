  <strong>Message from organizers</strong>:
  We would like to encourage participants to commit to two full days of intensive learning. We are running a experimental 
  "deep dive" into the subject and we are trying to learn if the dense two-day format is better for absorbing 
  and practicing the material. Think about it not as a typical workshop, but rather as a mini-bootcamp, where you 
  come to immerse yourself into data analysis with R and, hopefully, come out with some practical and immediately 
  applicable skills for making sense of your data. We would like to see the participants who have immediate data analysis 
  problems they are trying to solve, and would like to prioritize the teaching effort to those who need urgent assistance 
  and help to get started. Provided that this experiment is successful, we will be bringing more of similar exciting 
  offerings to you in the fall. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding.

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
  To participate in a Software Carpentry workshop, you will need
  access to the software described below. In addition, you will
  need an up-to-date web browser.
</p>
<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "{{site.swc_github}}/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.
</p>
<div id="r"> <!-- Start of 'R' section. -->
  <h3>R</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> is a programming language
    that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and
    statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use
    <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>.

        Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the 
        installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as 
        administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later, 
        for example when installing R packages.
